# User Day Timeline Visualization

[Live Demo](https://user-timeline-avag.vercel.app/)

## Description

This project is a web application that visually represents a user's day timeline on an interactive map. It retrieves data from the Supabase database, specifically the Places table, which contains information about events such as start and end timestamps, and latitude-longitude coordinates. The application then displays these events on a map using Google Maps API, allowing users to interactively explore their daily timeline.

## Features

- Displays user events on an interactive map.
- Supports switching between different days within a specified date range.
- Provides detailed event information upon hovering over map markers.
- Bonus feature: Utilizes Foursquare's Nearby Places API to fetch and display place names and categories for each event marker.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React
- Supabase (for database connection)
- Google Maps API
- Foursquare's Nearby Places API

## Credits

The project was developed by [Mariam Kilany].
